# ResPort
------
[Hackathon Project] ResPort (RESearch PORTal) is a portal intended to be used by the students and faculty of NJIT to help bring awareness to research opportunities for students and teachers. While this project is not 100% ready, below are some of the current functionalities we built within 24 hours of the competition:

Current Functionalities
---

Login Side:
 - Login by NJIT students only (We have functionality which ensures only NJIT students have access)
 - Login by teacher (locally set in MySQL database for project and testing purposes, since we don't have access for teacher credentials)
 
Faculty Side: 
 - Create and edit profile
 - Create research opportunities
 - Browse through that faculty's created opportunities
 
Student Side: 
 - Create and edit profile
 - Browse through different research opportunities and filter by college name within NJIT

What's Next?
---

We plan on adding following functionalities to this project:

Login Side:
 - Ensuring only NJIT faculty can login as a teacher, and not have it locally set in the database

Faculty Side:
 - See number of hearted research opportunities when browsing through opportunities next to the heart at the bottom of the page
 - Have the heart at the bottom of the page when browsing through opportunities be clickable
 - Once the heart is clicked on the above page, new page opens up where teacher can see the list of students who hearted the opportunity
 - Above list should contain student information (populated from their profile data)

Student Side:
 - Heart an opportunity 
 - Browse through hearted opportunities
 - Filter by key words when browsing opportunities
 - See teacher email at bottom of each opportunity so student can contact them, separately (maybe for future versions, use in-portal messaging).
